            <br>  When someone finds an impressive way to dress, it becomes a ‘fashion’.
            More and more people try to copy those same styles and it becomes a fashion. <br>
            The fashion Industry originates from France in Paris, which is still the Capital of the fashion world.
            <br> Trends are set in Paris which is copied all over the world. New York, London, Milan and Amsterdam are some other major fashion centres.
